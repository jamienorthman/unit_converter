This is a SOLO project from Scrimba.com

It uses a button-click-eventListener to produce metric and imperial units of measurement based on the user's input.

Once working, the goal was to then do some function-refactoring and make the Javascript more dynamic, using less HTML. Now more information can be added to the units array without breaking the program.
